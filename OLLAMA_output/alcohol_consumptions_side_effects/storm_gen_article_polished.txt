# summary

Alcohol consumption has been a ubiquitous aspect of human culture for centuries, with varying degrees of acceptance and regulation across different societies. However, as the global prevalence of alcohol use continues to rise, so too do concerns about its detrimental effects on health and well-being. Excessive drinking is a leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide, accounting for millions of cases of illness, injury, and premature mortality each year [1]. The immediate and short-term consequences of alcohol consumption can be severe, ranging from hangovers and accidents to increased risk of violence and impaired judgment [2]. Furthermore, chronic heavy drinking has been linked to a range of long-term health problems, including liver disease, heart conditions, and certain types of cancer [3]. Despite growing awareness about the risks associated with excessive drinking, many individuals continue to struggle with alcoholism, highlighting the need for effective prevention and treatment strategies.
The impact of alcohol consumption on individuals and communities is multifaceted and far-reaching. Not only can it lead to physical harm, but also social and economic consequences, including increased healthcare costs, lost productivity, and strained relationships [4]. In addition, excessive drinking has been linked to a range of social problems, including domestic violence, child abuse, and public disorder [5]. As the global community grapples with the challenges posed by alcohol consumption, it is essential to understand both the causes and consequences of this complex issue.
The effects of alcohol consumption on individuals can be devastating, with many experiencing significant impairment in their daily lives. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 3 million deaths worldwide are attributed to excessive drinking each year [6]. Moreover, chronic heavy drinking is a major risk factor for a range of health problems, including liver cirrhosis, heart failure, and certain types of cancer.
In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the need for evidence-based approaches to addressing excessive drinking. This includes the development of effective prevention strategies, such as public education campaigns and harm reduction initiatives [7]. However, more work is needed to address the complex social and cultural factors that contribute to alcohol consumption, particularly in high-risk populations.
