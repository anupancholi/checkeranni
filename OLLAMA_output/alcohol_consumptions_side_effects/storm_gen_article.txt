# Alcohol Consumption Side Effects

## Immediate and Short-Term Effects

The short-term effects of alcohol consumption are outlined below.[1] Excessive alcohol use can have immediate and long-term effects.[2] Like all drugs, alcohol can damage your body, especially if you drink heavily every day or in binges. Potential short-term effects of alcohol include hangover and alcohol poisoning,[3] as well as falls and accidents, conflict, lowered inhibitions and risky behaviours.

## Long-Term Effects

Long-term effects of excessive alcohol consumption can be severe and far-reaching.[1] Chronic heavy drinking can lead to liver disease, heart problems, and certain types of cancer.[2][3] Alcoholism is a common long-term effect of excessive drinking, characterized by dependence on the substance despite negative consequences.
