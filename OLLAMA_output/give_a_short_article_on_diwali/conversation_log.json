The festival is also linked to the goddess Lakshmi, who is revered for her role in bringing prosperity and good fortune.\n\nIn Sikhism, Diwali is celebrated as Guru Hargobind's return to Amritsar from captivity in Gwalior, which is seen as a symbol of liberation and freedom. Sikhs light lamps throughout the city to commemorate this occasion.\n\nBuddhists celebrate Diwali as a commemoration of Emperor Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism in the 3rd century BCE. This event is significant because it marked a turning point in Buddhist history, as Ashoka became a patron of Buddhism and helped spread its teachings throughout India.\n\nJains also celebrate Diwali, which is known as Dipavali, as a time of spiritual renewal and self-reflection.

While there are references to the cultural significance and symbolism of light in Hinduism (sources 7, 8), they do not provide specific information about the origins of Diwali.\nHowever, I can provide some general information about Diwali based on other sources. According to source 5, Diwali has its roots over 2,500 years ago and is a festival that stretches back to ancient times. The name \"Diwali\" or \"Deepavali\" means \"row of lights\" in Sanskrit (source 4). In Hindu mythology, Diwali is associated with the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after a 14-year exile (source 8). According to legend, Rama's victory over his brother Ravana and his wife Sita was celebrated by the people of Ayodhya, who lit lamps and fireworks to welcome their king back home. While the exact origins of Diwali are unclear, it is believed to have originated in ancient India as a festival of lights that symbolized the triumph of good over evil (source 7). The festival has since evolved and spread to other parts of the world, becoming an important cultural event for Hindus around the globe.\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to understand how Diwali reflects the evolution of knowledge systems in ancient India.
