# Diwali

Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a significant festival in Hinduism and is celebrated over five days in autumn. It is a time for family reunions, gift-giving, and feasting, and is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" (1). The word "Diwali" comes from the Sanskrit word "dipavali," which means "row of lights" (2).
The festival has its roots in ancient India and is believed to have originated over 3,000 years ago. According to Hindu mythology, Diwali commemorates the return of Lord Rama, a king who was exiled for 14 years, to his kingdom after defeating the demon king Ravana (3). The villagers lit lamps to welcome Rama back home, and this tradition has been passed down through generations.
Diwali is also associated with the goddess Lakshmi, who is revered as the embodiment of wealth, prosperity, and good fortune. Hindus believe that during Diwali, the goddess Lakshmi travels through the earth, bestowing her blessings on those who worship her (4).
The festival is celebrated in different ways across India, depending on regional traditions and customs. In some parts of the country, people light diyas (small earthenware lamps filled with oil) to invite the presence of Lakshmi, while in others, they use candles or electric lights (5). Fireworks and crackers are also an integral part of Diwali celebrations, adding to the festive atmosphere.
Diwali is not only a celebration of lights but also has significant economic and cultural importance. It is a major shopping season, with people buying gifts, new clothes, and other items (6). The festival also promotes unity and social harmony, as people come together to exchange gifts, share meals, and participate in community events.
In addition to its Hindu significance, Diwali is also celebrated by some Buddhists and Jains, who commemorate the day when Emperor Ashoka converted to Buddhism (7). In Nepal, the Vajrayana Buddhist minority observes Diwali as a special occasion, lighting lamps to celebrate the light of Mahavira's holy knowledge (8).
