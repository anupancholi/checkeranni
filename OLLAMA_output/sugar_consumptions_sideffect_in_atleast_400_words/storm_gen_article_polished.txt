# summary

Consuming high amounts of sugar has been linked to various side effects on both physical and mental health, with far-reaching implications for public health. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults limit their daily sugar intake to less than 10% of total energy intake, yet many individuals exceed this threshold, leading to a range of negative consequences.
Research has consistently shown that excessive sugar consumption is associated with an increased risk of metabolic problems, including weight gain, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (Johnson et al., 2007; de Koning et al., 2017). Furthermore, a diet rich in added sugars has been linked to cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure, heart attacks, and strokes (de Koning et al., 2017). The mechanisms underlying these effects are complex, involving inflammation, oxidative stress, and changes in brain chemistry and structure.
In addition to its physical side effects, sugar consumption has also been implicated in neurological problems, including impaired recognition memory, spatial memory, and cognitive function (Avena et al., 2008). Moreover, excessive sugar intake has been linked to nutrient deficiencies, particularly vitamin D and B12 deficiency (Burt et al., 2005; Mattes et al., 2014).
The consequences of sugar consumption are not limited to individual health outcomes. The global sugar industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution, highlighting the need for a more sustainable approach to food production and consumption (Harris et al., 2017). As the global population continues to grow and urbanize, addressing the public health implications of sugar consumption will require a coordinated effort from policymakers, healthcare professionals, and individuals.

# Side Effects of Sugar Consumption

Consuming high amounts of sugar has been linked to various side effects on both physical and mental health.

## Metabolic Problems

Consuming high amounts of sugar can lead to a range of metabolic problems, including weight gain, increased levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, leptin, glucose, and insulin (1). This can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.

## Cardiovascular Disease

A diet rich in added sugars has been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure, heart attacks, and strokes (2). This is because sugar consumption can lead to inflammation and oxidative stress in the body, which can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.

## Neurological Problems

Consuming high amounts of sugar has also been linked to a range of neurological problems, including impaired recognition memory, spatial memory, and cognitive function (3). This is because sugar consumption can lead to changes in brain chemistry and structure, particularly in areas involved in reward processing and decision-making.

## Addiction and Withdrawal

Some research suggests that consuming high amounts of sugar can lead to addiction and withdrawal symptoms when it is suddenly stopped or reduced (4). These symptoms can include cravings, headaches, bloating, and irritability. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between sugar consumption and addiction.

## Other Side Effects

In addition to these side effects, consuming high amounts of sugar has also been linked to a range of other health problems, including:
* Increased risk of certain types of cancer, such as pancreatic cancer (5)
* Premature aging and wrinkles (6)
* Tooth decay and other oral health problems (7)
* Nutrient deficiencies, particularly vitamin D and B12 deficiency (8)
